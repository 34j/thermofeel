Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI)
======================================
The universal thermal climate index (UTCI), is a bioclimatological model of an average human bodyâ€™s response
to different thermal conditions, where the subject is
not acclimatised to the climate and is outdoors, doing minimal work


How To Use
======================================
You will need 2m temperature in kelvin, mean radiant temperature in kelvin,
optional relative humidity because it can be calculated from 2m temperature and 10 meter wind speed.

.. code-block:: python
    calculate_utci(2m temperature,mean radiant temperature,
    relative humidity, wind speed)


Interpret the Output
======================================
