Apparent Temperature
======================================


How To Use
======================================
You need 2m temperature in kelvin, wind speed at 10 meters
and optional relative humidity as water vapour pressure,
because this can be calculated from 2m temperature.

The wind speed in this method is converted to 2 meters as
an approximation of 1.2 meter wind speed.

.. code-block:: python
    calculate_heat_index(2m temperature,relative humidity,wind speed)
