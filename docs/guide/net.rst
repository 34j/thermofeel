Net Effective Temperature (NET)
======================================

Net effective temperature (NET) is also known as normal effective temperature. It links effective temperature which indicates \
the effects on comfort through air temperature and relative humidity \
and an organismâ€™s thermoregulatory capacity.

How To Use
======================================
You need 2m temperature in kelvin, wind speed at 10 meters height
and optional relative humidity as water vapour pressure,
because this can be calculated from 2m temperature.

The wind speed in this method is converted to 2 meters as
an approximation of 1.2 meter wind speed.

.. code-block:: python
    calculate_heat_index(2m temperature,wind speed, relative humidity)

Interpret the Output
======================================
Here is a suggested way for you to interpret Net Effective Temperature outputs, it is by no means the only way to go about defining thermal stress.
